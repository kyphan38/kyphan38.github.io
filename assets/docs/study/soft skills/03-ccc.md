This section covers teamwork and team building practices

Like most context sections, this section starts and ends with an assessment

Topics include Learning and Teaching, Mobbing and Co-creating, Social Grease, and Observation

The ending video talks about Team Dynamics and a scenario for team building and team

## Teaching and learning

Why it should matter to teams?

- Teams that grow together stay together and produce

Strengthening team bonds

- The collective growth of a team is skill enhancement and forging stronger bonds and building a resilient team

Learning together: Workshops, POCs, Problem-solving

- Attending classes, meetups, and workshops together
- Tackling POCs and new ideas
- Studying and practicing together

A culture of knowledge sharing

- Demos and show me's
- Mentoring
- Tech-back and Lunch N' Learns
- Speaking at conferences

**Summary**

- Teaching and learning are information-based ways to create connections within and outside teams
- Teaching internally and externally also adds value to those audiences
- Learning together also raises the general skill level of the team
- Creating and prioritizing learning and learning in an organization is essential in high-performing teams

## Co-creating and mobbing

Why?

- The sum is often greater than its parts in IT - collective action breeds innovation, automation, and efficiency

Understanding the concepts

- Co-creating and mobbing emphasize joint action and shared responsibility in project tasks

Collaborating for enhanced outcomes

- The essence of co-creating and mobbing lies in harnessing the collective power of the team for superior outcomes

Strengthening team bonds

- Co-creating and mobbing are powerful tools for building unity and strengthening team bonds

Pair and mob programming

- Pair programming is a method where two developers work together at one workstation
- Mob programming is an extension of pair programming, involving the whole team working on the same problem, at the same time, in the same space (physically or virtually)

Quality today, speed later

- Collaborative approaches like pair and mob programming can lead to fewer errors, less rework, and more sustainable solutions, ultimately saving time in the long run

**Summary**

- Co-creating and mobbing are group concepts to increase long-term output and collaboration
- Co-creating is about co-creating documents, code, and tasks, while mobbing is similar but focuses on problem or troubleshooting
- Both are co-creation techniques where one person drives and one or more people "assist" or watch
- Both techniques enhance output and team cohesion

## Social grease and the water cooler

The power of social grease

- Social grease is the intangible yet vital element that facilitates smoother interactions and stronger connections within teams

Trust and informal interactions

- Trust is often built not in the midst of project deadlines, but in the casual, informal interactions that occur between them

Understanding the "water cooler"

- The 'water cooler' has long been symbolic of a place where colleagues gather for informal chats, often leading to unexpected insights and strengthened relationships

Being curious about our team members

- A little curiosity goes a long way in building a cohesive and collaborative team

Designing spaces for social interaction

- Just as formal meeting rooms are important, the informal spaces (physical or virtual) where team members can connect casually are also important

Why such interactions matter of DevOps cultures

- It's the unstructured, informal interactions that often spark creativity and strengthen team bonds
- These conversations spark creativity, enhance problem-solving, and boost team morale and cohesion

**Summary**

- The concept of social grease is about this hidden currency we acquire through informal interactions
- These interactions based on curiosity about our co-workers and their lives outside of work create trust and cohesion
- The "Water Cooler" is a metaphor for a safe space for informal interaction
- Being intentional about safe informal spaces is part of an intentional crafting of a DevOps Culture

## Observation and context

## Making work visible

## Story - how to wreck a team versus how to align it
