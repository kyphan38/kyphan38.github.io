> "The core of all successful DevOps implementations is the recognition that bad communication leads to friction" - Grant Fritchey

## Verbal skills

Effective verbal communication in DevOps relies on the 7 C's: Clear, Concise, Correct, Coherent, Complete, Concrete, Courteous

Clear

- Avoid using acronyms or jargon that your audience may not know
- Don't use unnecessarily complex or elevated language
- Keep your message simple, direct, and easy to understand
- Speak clearly, use precise language, and structure your points logically
- Example: Instead of saying, "We'll use CI/CD," clarify with, "We'll use continuous integration and continuous deployment to automate testing and delivery"

Concise

- Express your thoughts in as few words as necessary without sacrificing clarity
- Complex ideas are built from simple ones. Break them down
- Avoid filler words and redundancies
- Say more with less: Short, impactful messages are easier to understand and remember

Correct

- Use precise vocabulary and proper grammar
- Ensure facts, figures, and terminology are accurate and contextually appropriate
- Mistakes in speech can lead to misunderstandings, especially in technical environments

Coherent

- Organize your thoughts logically
- Ensure each idea connects to the next in a smooth, structured manner
- Example structure
  - Start &rarr; Identify topic &rarr; Organize main points &rarr; Develop supporting details &rarr; Ensure logical flow &rarr; Review and edit
  - Topic: Effective Study Habits
  - Main Points
    - MP 1: Time management
    - MP 2: Active engagement
    - MP 3: Effective note-taking
    - MP 4: Setting goals
  - Develop Supporting Details
    - MP 1: Create a schedule, prioritize tasks
    - MP 2: Ask questions, participate actively
    - MP 3: Use summaries and keywords
    - MP 4: Set short- and long-term goals, track progress
  - Ensure logical flow
    - Arrange main points in a logical sequence
    - Use transitions to connect ideas smoothly
  - Review and edit
    - Check for coherence, clarity, and consistency
    - Edit for grammar, punctuation, and spelling

Complete

- Ensure your message answers the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How
- The listener should have enough information to take action or fully understand the topic
- Anticipate potential questions and preemptively address them

Concrete

- Use specific, vivid, and detailed language
- Avoid vague or abstract statements
- Help the listener visualize what you're describing with real examples or analogies
- Example: Instead of saying "Improve system performance," say "Reduce server response time by optimizing database queries"

Courteous

- Always treat others with respect and professionalism
- Use a polite, positive tone
- Acknowledge others' contributions and express appreciation for their time and input
- Courteous communication builds trust and goodwill

> Convey clear, correct, and concrete concepts in a concise, coherent, and courteous manner for complete comprehension

**Summary**

- This section on Communication skills focuses on qualities and attributes that are commonly agreed as beneficial
- We review the 7 C's, namely, Clear, Concise, Correct, Coherent, Complete, Concrete, and Courteous
- We covered tips and examples in each section
- The phrase at the end is to help you memorize the attributes which also apply to a certain extent to written communication skills as well

## Written skills

Good writing skills and verbal skills

- Written communication is a cornerstone in DevOps due to the distributed nature of teams, often spanning different locations, time zones, and working styles
- Clarity in writing ensures alignment, reduces errors, and fosters collaboration across asynchronous work environments

The 7C's also apply to written communication

- Applying the 7 C's - Clear, Concise, Concrete, Correct, Coherent, Complete, Courteous to your writing significantly improves its effectiveness
- If you can confidently answer the 7 C's when reviewing your message, you're likely communicating extremely effectively

Tailor the message to the mode or medium

- Different platforms require different tones and levels of detail
  - A Slack message might be brief and informal
  - A design document should be structured, detailed, and formal
- Always adjust your style to suit the communication channel and its purpose

Adjust the message to the audience

- Take the time to fully understand the message before responding
- Thoughtful reading avoids misinterpretation and ensures your reply is relevant and constructive

Proofing

- Always check for grammar, spelling, and clarity before sending any written communication
- Use tools like Grammarly, Microsoft Word Spell Check, or browser extensions to catch common errors and improve tone

Visual aids and formatting for readability

- Even in simple emails, visual elements (like bullets, bold text, or headings) can help clarify key ideas
- Proper formatting improves scannability and comprehension
- Professional email structure
  - Subject Line: Clear, specific, and informative
  - Greeting: Polite and professional to set a positive tone
  - Body: Includes context, purpose, and relevant details
  - Closing: Courteous and appreciative to encourage goodwill and response

**Summary**

- Written skills also benefit from the 7 C's, but there is more variability to written communication
- The medium (instant messaging, email, text, design document, etc.) greatly influences what is appropriate communication
- The target audience for your communication also greatly influences what words, tone, and formatting you will use
- Professional communication of all types, except informal interactions, are usually checked for spelling, grammar, and readability

## Nonverbal skills

Why it matters?

- Nonverbal communication often conveys emotions and attitudes more accurately than words, making it essential for understanding team dynamics and managing interpersonal relationships

Body language

- Body language speaks volumes, often louder than words
- Key points
  - Posture - Signals confidence, openness, or discomfort
  - Gestures - Reinforce spoken words or indicate emotion
  - Mirroring - Subtly reflecting others' movements builds rapport and trust

Voice tone

- The tone of voice can completely change the message. It's not just what you say, but how you say it
- Different tones for different contexts
  - Soothing
    - Speak slowly and calmly, with warmth and a slightly lower pitch
    - Offer empathy and reassurance during stressful times
    - Useful during system outages, crises, or emotionally tense moments
  - Openness
    - Use an enthusiastic and engaging tone with slight pitch elevation
    - Show interest in others' ideas and encourage collaboration
    - Ideal for brainstorming, feedback sessions, or team building
  - Boundary-setting
    - Speak with clarity and firmness; use pauses for emphasis
    - Clearly set limits and expectations
    - Effective for managing resources, setting deadlines, or enforcing policies
  - Direct
    - Speak with purpose and at a steady pace
    - Keep communication concise and unambiguous
    - Best for time-sensitive tasks or urgent decision-making

Micro-expressions

- Our facial expressions often reveal emotions before we speak, especially in high-stress or collaborative settings
- Key points
  - Brief and rapid
  - Involuntary
  - Reveal honest, true emotion, even when someone tries to mask their feelings

Eye contact

- Eye contact is a powerful tool in building trust and connection
- Guidelines
  - Maintain eye contact 50% of the time when speaking
  - Maintain 70% of the time when listening
  - Too little may seem evasive; too much may feel aggressive, balance is key

Personal space management

- Often overlooked, personal space is a critical part of nonverbal communication, especially in diverse, cross-cultural teams like DevOps
- Considerations
  - Gender - Comfort zones may vary
  - Personal preference - Respect individual boundaries
  - Culture - Some cultures value close proximity, others value distance

**Summary**

- Non-verbal communication encompasses aspects like tone of voice, body language, facial expressions, eye contact, and personal space
- This can play a pivotal role in DevOps communications and is considered more important than the information
- Body language is arguably one of the most important tools, with mirroring being the most important
- Tone of voice is probably the second most important as it has the biggest impact after body language

## Professionalism

What it means?

- Professionalism refers to the emphasis on a "detached yet engaged" conduct, behavior, and attitude of an individual in a work environment
- It's about being present, respectful, and effective without allowing personal emotions or biases to interfere

    - Maintaining confidentiality
  - Implicitly defined behaviors
    - Showing initiative
    - Being adaptable to change
    - Demonstrating a positive attitude under pressure
- These behaviors collectively create a productive, respectful, and growth-oriented workplace environment

Balancing personality with impartiality

## Story - Information versus story

Context

- The speaker was once asked to present to a group of engineers about the value of AWS certifications at a former company
- He built a slide deck full of facts, stats, and bullet points but during the actual presentation, the audience visibly disengaged: phone-checking, zoning out, even dozing off
- The issue wasn't the accuracy of the information, it was the lack of emotional connection or narrative structure. It was technically correct, but it didn't land
- This sparked an insight: information by itself is not enough to connect and influence, you need to tell a story
- In his next presentation, the speaker reframed the content as a relatable journey with context, color, challenge, and resolution and the impact was night and day
- This scenario underscores a core truth: people don't remember raw data, they remember how it made them feel and if they could see themselves in it

Actions and result

- Transform information into narrative
  - Rebuilt the presentation using storytelling techniques started with real-world challenges, gave the problem some emotional color, then offered AWS as the resolution
  - The audience leaned in. They saw themselves in the story. They connected emotionally, and the message landed far more effectively than the data dump ever could
- Speak to the audience's reality
  - Instead of staying abstract, the speaker addressed the actual pain points of operations engineers - tech sprawl, outdated infrastructure, burnout and showed how AWS could solve their problems
  - The presentation became relevant. The audience felt understood, not sold to. This opened the door to engagement, curiosity, and motivation
- Use character and personalization
  - Replaced faceless stats with real characters and scenarios like Sarah, a high-performing team member who left due to lack of growth to humanize abstract points
  - The data took on meaning. The audience could connect emotionally, making the takeaway more memorable and more impactful
- Structure with a narrative arc
  - Framed content in a simple arc beginning (problem), middle (struggle), and end (resolution with insight). Even three sentences can do the trick
  - The message felt like a journey instead of a lecture. It had movement, tension, and resolution - all the ingredients of something worth remembering
- Tailor the message to the listener
  - Considered the audience and adjusted tone, language, and examples accordingly engineers got ops-specific examples, leaders got value and ROI frames
  - The audience stayed engaged because the speaker spoke their language. They didn't have to translate or connect the dots, it was done for them
