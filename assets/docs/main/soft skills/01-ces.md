- Honest and true emotion

Eye contact: A simple yet powerful aspect of non-verbal communication, plays a crucial role in establishing connections and trust

Personal space management: Though often overlooked, is a critical component of non-verbal communication, particularly in diverse and collaborative environments like DevOps

- Gender

## Professionalism

It refers to the emphasis of a "detached yet engaged" conduct, behavior, and attitude of an individual in a work environment

Communication threads the needle of success, professionalism is the fabric that holds it all together

Defining behaviors: Professional behaviors encompass a range of actions and attitudes that collectively define how we conduct ourselves in a professional setting. Effective workplace behaviors are crucial for fostering a positive and productive environment

- Explicitly defined behaviors: Communication protocol, meeting deadlines, maintaining confidentiality
- Implicitly defined behaviors: Showing initiative, being adaptable to change, demonstrating a positive attitude under pressure

Balancing personality with impartiality: The art of communication often lies in striking the right balance between being personally engaged and maintaining professional detachment

- Engaged yet impersonal
- Focused, neutral to upbeat demeanor
- You're not getting into a deep story or engagement about some's personal life
- Staying connected to your work and colleagues while maintaining impartiality and not letting personal issues interfere with work
- As a DevOps engineer, one should focus on DevOps-related tasks rather than getting distracted by irrelevant personal matters

How and when to apply it: Everyday communications from emails to team chats, are opportunities to demonstrate professionalism

- The 7 C’s help - clear, respectful
- Timeliness and responsiveness
- Constructive and progressive
- Consistency in reaction and action

Strategies to navigate challenges

- Problems: Conflict, stress, misunderstanding
- Solutions: Mindfulness and meditation practices, active listening and cueing, expressing empathy, seeking feedback

## Story - Information versus story

Context: Forrester provides background on an earlier presentation he gave about the value of AWS certifications to his team. In his initial presentation, he used a slide deck filled with generic data about cloud adoption and AWS, which was popular for operational offloading. However, the audience seemed disengaged, and Forrester noticed that his information was out of context, uninspiring, bland, and not framed in a way that connected with the audience emotionally or intellectually

Solutions

- Recognizing the problem: After noticing that the audience was disengaged, Forrester realized his mistake. He had focused on presenting raw facts and data without considering the emotional and contextual elements of storytelling. He acknowledged the importance of engaging the audience on a deeper level rather than just delivering dry information
- Changing approach: For his next presentation to a similar group, he decided to take a different approach by framing the information in a relevant contextual story. Instead of just listing statistics, he painted a picture of the rapidly evolving tech landscape and the challenges teams face, such as dealing with end-of-life infrastructure and tech sprawl
- Incorporating storytelling: He used a real-world story of a team that had transformed their operations by migrating to AWS. This allowed him to weave technical information into a narrative that was more relatable and engaging. He also highlighted the benefits of AWS certifications not only for the company but also for personal career growth
- Framing the message as a story: He structured the information around a problem to be solved, transformation, and resolution. This approach made the information more relatable by introducing characters (e.g., "Sarah," a team member), a conflict, and a resolution. He framed the skills learned from the AWS certification not just as business benefits but also as personal career opportunities
- Practical advice: He introduced the importance of soft skills for career growth, mentioning how DevOps soft skills can help professionals manage teams, inspire others, and communicate effectively in leadership roles

Technique

- Find the human connection: Think about the audience and what kind of problems they have or talk about someone's experience
- Create a narrative arc: Start with the problem, clarity, resolution

Result: The result of this new approach was positive. By framing the presentation as a story, Forrester was able to engage the audience on a deeper, emotional level. The story made the information more memorable and relatable, and the audience could see themselves in the narrative. Forrester was able to effectively communicate the value of AWS certifications, not only in terms of operational benefits for the business but also as a means for personal career development. This approach led to better engagement and a more compelling presentation that resonated with the audience
