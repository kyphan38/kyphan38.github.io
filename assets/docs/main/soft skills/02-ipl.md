Enacting recognition: Recognizing and celebrating team achievements is not just about giving credit, it's about fueling motivation and fostering a positive team culture!

- Not only individuals but also teams and departments

Empowerment in action

- Context: The speaker reflects on their experience working at a company where leadership was negative and critical. The leaders often focused on criticizing efforts, creating a team environment where individuals felt unempowered to improve or take initiative. Despite having a few standout engineers who received recognition for firefighting and reactive problem-solving, the overall culture was one where teams were not encouraged to be proactive or innovate
- Solutions:
  - A new leader was brought in, who had a different approach
  - This new leader focused on recognizing teams for their ability to embody company values and make different choices
  - Rather than rewarding merely solving problems or fixing issues, the leader began rewarding innovation, experimentation, and proactive efforts that improved the company’s processes, technology, and teamwork
  - The leader celebrated the process-choices and principles-over just focusing on the final outcome or fixed problems
  - The new leader emphasized rewarding behaviors, choices, and effort rather than just rewarding when the problem was solved or a goal was reached
- Result:
  - The team began evolving and improving, moving away from the reactive, “firefighting” approach to addressing issues
  - Innovation, experimentation, and proactive problem-solving became more recognized and valued, leading to a healthier team dynamic
  - The system itself improved, which in turn made it more effective for the people using it
  - The overall atmosphere of the workplace shifted from critical and negative to one where people felt more empowered to contribute meaningfully to both the processes and the outcomes
  - The new leadership also showed the importance of rewarding the journey, the process, and the effort-important for infinite games (like careers or company missions) - rather than just the outcome, which contributed to a deeper sense of purpose and continuous improvement

## Creating safety and trust

Trust is the foundation for effective collaboration, especially in environments where rapid decision-making and flexibility are required. Psychological safety allows team members to express ideas and concerns without fear of negative consequences, leading to more innovative and creative problem-solving

Trust isn't just a value or buzzword; it's the foundation of high-performing teams

Pillars of trust and safety

- Trust and safety both are about agreements
- Trust is about agreements on expectations, expressed and unexpressed
  - We know what team members are going to do or involves confidence in their decision-making, reliability, transparency around the communication, visibility of the work, etc.
- Safety is about an inherent agreement that a person will not be attacked or assaulted in any way
  - Team member feel secure to express ideas, ask questions and raise concerns

Building trust through agreements: Trust is built by repeated communication and action that is in alignment with agreements and expectations

- Agreements and expectations come from all of the people that you interact with, including the people who consume your software, services, web pages

Fostering a safe environment: It is built through consistent respect of people and their contribution

- Expectation
- Agreement
- Right
- Physical
- Emotional
- Mental

Cultivating trust and safety - If a leader value people, he/she don't want them to overwork

- Open communication
- Opportunities for growth
- Supportive atmosphere

Acceptable behaviors and reactions: The tone you set directly influences the behaviors and reactions within your team

- If you want your teams to do certain things, you have to do some version of those things
- You want them to be methodical? You got to be methodical

Establishing clear goals and boundaries

- Set clear goals
- Define boundaries
- Establish expectations
- Provide feedback

Acting in alignment with agreements

- One of the worst ways that you can break trust and safety inside an organization is layoffs

- Renegotiating agreements can break a little bit of trust, but not nearly as much trust as braking agreements
- If you break an agreement and you don't communicate about the breaking of that agreement, you are losing the absolute maximum amount of trust and safety that you can have with the person that you are in the agreement with

Trust and safety in action

- Context: The speaker was hired as an architect and joined a team. The team initially seemed amazing, but the dynamics shifted when one particular individual joined the group. The speaker observed that this person caused the team to behave differently—lowering their engagement, changing body language, and altering how they communicated. As the team lead, the speaker noticed that this person didn't meet expectations, missed deadlines, disregarded the company mission, and did not stay within the scope of their role. Despite attempts to enroll this individual in the company’s mission or suggest a move to another department, the situation remained unresolved until the person was eventually removed
- Solutions
  - The speaker took on the role of observing and analyzing the team's behavior closely, noting the subtle shifts when this individual interacted with the team
  - The speaker made several attempts to intervene by enrolling the problematic team member, trying to communicate the expectations, and suggesting they move to a different department if they weren’t aligned with the team’s goals
  - After multiple attempts to correct the behavior, the team member was ultimately removed from the team, which restored the team’s functionality and cohesion
- Result
  - The immediate result of removing the non-compliant team member was that trust and safety were restored within the team
  - With the problematic member gone, the team naturally reformed into a high-performing group, which suggests that the issue was significant enough to hinder their performance
  - The speaker highlights how one individual’s behavior can disrupt the entire system, affecting not just their performance but the entire team’s dynamics

## What you say vs what you do

The congruence between what we say and what we do is pivotal at any level

Balancing communication and action: The balance and harmony between what we do and what we say, defines our success in any environment

Aligning words with actions: The alignment of what you say and what you do is not just influential, it's transformative

- What you say (words): The manager instructs the team to work efficiently to meet the project deadline
- What you do (actions): Later, a team member sees the manager procrastinating, causing project delays
- &rarr; misalignment

Limitations of actions alone: Actions can speak volumes in DevOps

- If you are doing things and you are not communicating about that

![img](./img/4.png)

- Don't know about it
- Don't want it
- Don't understand why you did it

Achieving trust through consistency: A consistent alignment between what a person says and does is the cornerstone of building trust and achieving results

- If you are just doing your own thing, not seeking feedback, not staying in alignment with the strategies, the mission, the values, and the principles of your department, org, etc. you are out of alignment and that misalignment is the number one destroyer of teams, departments, and companies
- It would be better for all of you to fail and learn together than to have four people on a team go on one direction and one person go another direction. That person' right, the other four are wrong

## Persuasion versus manipulation

In leadership and communication, there's a fine line between persuasion and manipulation

The greatest power lies in influencing with integrity, not manipulating with deceit

- Persuasion: Honesty, empathy, trustworthiness, mutual benefit
- Manipulation: Deception, exploitation, lack of empathy, self-serving motives

Persuasion vs manipulation

- A deeper definition
  - P: Ethical influence using reasoning, discussion, and moral appeal
  - M: Unethical influence through deception or coercion, often for the manipulator's benefit
- Positive (persuasion) vs negative (Manipulation)
  - P: An ethical approach to influence, where the goal is to convince someone through reasoning, discussion, and moral appeal. Those are honest, transparent, respectful, mutual benefit, empathy
  - M: An unethical form of influence that involves deceiving or coercing someone into a desired outcome, often for the manipulator's benefit. Those are deceptive, coercive, exploitative, selfish, toxic
- Key differences
  - P: Reason, respect for autonomy, ethical and positive, connecting
  - M: Emotion, control, unethical and toxic, isolating
  - Corresponding: Decision, right, behavior, action
- Examples
  - P: Project adoption, collaboration, adapting to change, getting buy-in
  - M: Exploiting insecurities, misleading information, fear or guilt tactics, gaslighting or questioning views on reality
- Cultivating ethical influence
  - Lead by example
  - Promote transparency
  - Encourage data-driven informed decisions
  - Respect and encourage team autonomy

## Story - the loudest promise

Context: The speaker was a systems administrator at a small startup. The company was growing, and the speaker had to implement a change to adhere to a new company standard for login names, transitioning from informal usernames (like “Michael”) to a formal standard (like “M.F. Forrester”). After making this change, the CEO stormed into the speaker’s office and aggressively yelled at them, accusing them of ruining the company’s culture and potentially wrecking the organization. The CEO was furious about the decision despite it being a part of company protocol. The speaker’s boss, Joe, intervened, defended the speaker, and clarified that the decision to make the change had been directed by him, not the speaker

Solutions

- The speaker made the change based on company policy to formalize employee logins, using data provided by HR
- The CEO reacted with extreme anger, yelling at the speaker and physically confronting them by standing on their desk, accusing them of jeopardizing the company
- Joe, the speaker’s boss, stepped in calmly but assertively, told the CEO to get off the desk, and explained that the decision came from him, not the speaker. Joe also stood firm in ensuring the speaker was treated with respect
- The speaker reflected on the situation and realized the importance of psychological safety and mutual trust between leaders and their teams. This incident highlighted an invisible agreement or unwritten contract that exists between leaders and their teams — an agreement to create a safe and respectful environment where trust is upheld

Result

- The CEO’s anger and accusation were defused by Joe’s intervention, which helped alleviate the speaker’s distress. Joe’s defense created a safe space for the speaker, reinforcing their sense of trust in their boss and the organization
- The speaker came to understand that leadership involves an unwritten covenant with the team — a commitment to uphold certain values and behaviors, such as respect, trust, and psychological safety. This realization shaped the speaker’s views on leadership and the importance of maintaining the invisible agreement with the team
- Impact on Leadership
  - Leaders must ensure their actions, decisions, and communications align with the values of trust, respect, and dignity to maintain a healthy team environment
  - When this invisible agreement is broken, as it was by the CEO's outburst, it can damage relationships and undermine trust, which takes significant time and effort to rebuild
  - The speaker emphasizes that the most important promises leaders make are those conveyed through their actions, decisions, and behavior, not just through words

Summary about leadership

- Communicate openly and honestly - Be transparent about your decisions and your expectations
- Listen actively and seek feedback from your team members
- Show empathy - Consider your team's perspectives and try to reconcile them and understand them because it'll actually tell you why they are operating the way they are
- Be consistent, trustworthy - Your actions should always align with your words, values
- Advocate for your team - Show consistently that you are gonna stand up for them and their needs
- Be aware of your actions - It could either reinforce or create trust, or erode that trust you have in your teams. Or, every decision you make is either expressing your values and aligning and sending messages to the team, or it is showing misalignment with our values
- The loudest promise is not the one that we make out loud. It is the one we make every day through our actions, choices, words. It is the promise to be the leader and our team can rely on it
- Never forget both the responsibility and the power of that invisible agreement. Nurture it, honor it, and always strive to be worthy of the trust that your team places in you
