# consulting client management

This section talks about a new definition of clients that includes everyone you connect with in a workplace

The clients inside a company will be treated very differently than the ones "outside" of a company

The scenario video will cover how to engage with peers, leaders, and subordinates as well as clients inside and outside a company

Negotiating conflict is essential because it is rare and yet important when it arises. Having a method deal with is essential

## Identifying clients

Redefining "client"

- The term "client" extends far beyond external customers to encompass everyone (boss, coworkers, employees, etc.), we interact with professionally

Managing your leaders

- Understand your boss's priorities
  - In terms of title, they have different concerns which are related to strategy
- Proactively communicate with minimal details
  - They want minimal amounts of communication, short contextual snippets
  - In an issue situation, they do not need to know what the problem is, who is on it, how they are fixing it, etc. These are saved for the engineers or the incident manager
- Continually seek feedback on major outcomes
  - They want to know how these things are operating
  - In a rollout situation, they want to know it is green or yellow or red? Do we have feature parity? What is the customer feedback?
- Progress to create alignment
  - Ensure everything is in alignment with our strategy, mission, and vision
- Be consistent to build trust and rapport (close relationship)

Engaging your peers

- Your co-workers are more than just team members
- They are your internal clients, each with unique needs and contributions

Nurturing your employees as clients

- Understand their ambitions
  - If they don't have, let's connect with them things related to goals, needs, desire
  - Average actually runs the world, exceptional changes it
- Provide feedback and guidance to their needs and goals
- Create opportunities for them to grow
- Be transparent, protective, and curious
  - Give them a sense that you are on their team and have got their backs
  - When they have made a mistake and you need to offer correction
  - Also, to be curious about what they are doing and working for you, to be observant and to listen what they tell you

External vs internal clients

- External clients usually pay the bills while internal clients provide the service to the external clients
- Professionalism is a must with external clients
- Higher standards in quality, positivity, and timeliness is required for external clients, but still needed for internal as well
  - Can-do positive attitude
  - They want to know you are at least willing to take in and consider their request or their idea
  - If you do make an agreement with a client, remember that you are at all times communicating that this is subject to change, interrupt and you absolutely must get this done by this time frame

Integrating a client-centric approach

- Always be curious
  - What is the client asking for that? What do they need it for?
- Active listening
- Communicate and document
  - Don't walk away from a meeting without having a summary and don't even get into a meeting without some kind of loose agenda
  - Eg: Here is the action items I have. Is this accurate from the last meeting? Yes, good. I am gonna start working on them
- Seek feedback and adapt to improve
  - When you tell them about the things you are working on, the direction you are heading, you are giving people opportunity to say "we are in alignment"

**Summary**

- We explored a broader definition of client that included leaders, coworkers, employees, and your external clients
- This concept is meant to encourage engagement and professionalism with all work relationships
- A client-centric approach also requires a systemic approach to navigating expectations and conflict
- Treating everyone as a client will create a deeper sense of rapport and alignment with everyone around you
