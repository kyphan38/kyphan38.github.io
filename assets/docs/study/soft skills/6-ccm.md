# consulting client management

This section talks about a new definition of clients that includes everyone you connect with in a workplace

Negotiating conflict is essential because it is rare and yet important when it arises. Having a method deal with is essential

## Identifying clients

Redefining "client"

- The term "client" extends far beyond external customers. It includes everyone we interact with professionally - bosses, coworkers, employees, and more

Managing your leaders

- Understand your boss's priorities
  - Leaders, due to their roles and titles, often focus on strategy and broader organizational goals
- Communicate proactively, with minimal details
  - They prefer concise, contextual updates
  - During incidents, avoid overloading them with details (e.g., the root cause, who's fixing it). That level of detail is for engineers or the incident manager
- Seek ongoing feedback on major outcomes
  - They want visibility into performance and impact
  - For rollouts, update them with clear statuses: is it green, yellow, or red? Do we have feature parity? What's the customer feedback?
- Create alignment
  - Ensure your work aligns with the organization's strategy, mission, and vision
- Be consistent to build trust and rapport (close relationship)
  - Consistency fosters reliability and strengthens professional relationships

Engaging your peers

- Your coworkers are more than team members - they are internal clients, each with unique needs and contributions

Nurturing your employees as clients

- Understand their ambitions
  - If they don't have clear goals, help connect their work to personal or professional aspirations
  - Remember: "Average runs the world, exceptional changes it"
- Provide feedback and guidance aligned with their goals
- Create opportunities for growth
- Be transparent, protective, and curious
  - Give them a sense that you are on their side and have their backs
  - Offer correction when needed, but also show genuine curiosity in their work
  - Be observant and attentive to what they say and do

External vs internal clients

- External clients usually pay the bills while internal clients provide the service to the external ones
- With external clients:
  - Maintain the highest levels of professionalism
  - Uphold strong standards in quality, positivity, and timeliness
  - Show a can-do, positive attitude - they want to feel heard and respected
  - When agreeing to something, communicate clearly that timelines and scopes are subject to change - but also show commitment to delivery

Integrating a client-centric approach

- Always be curious
  - Ask: Why is the client requesting this? What do they need it for?
- Practice active listening
- Communicate and document
  - Never leave a meeting without a clear summary
  - Never enter one without at least a loose agenda
  - Example: "Here are the action items I have - does this look accurate based on our last meeting?"
- Seek feedback and adapt to improve
  - Sharing your direction gives others a chance to confirm alignment or raise concerns

**Summary**

- We explored a broader definition of client that included leaders, coworkers, employees, and your external clients
- This concept is meant to encourage engagement and professionalism with all work relationships
- A client-centric approach also requires a systemic approach to navigating expectations and conflict
- Treating everyone as a client will create a deeper sense of rapport and alignment with everyone around you

## Internal versus external clients

Client management in general

- A nuanced understanding of both internal and external clients is essential for effective collaboration and project success

Internal and external clients - Definition

- Internal
  - Team members
  - Company leadership
  - Other departments within the organization
- External
  - Individuals or organizations outside the company who are impacted by your products or services
  - Their satisfaction directly influences revenue and reputation

Meeting diverse needs

- Balancing the often divergent needs of internal and external clients is crucial for any project's success

Context

- The focus of the speaker's talk is on managing relationships upwards (with bosses), downwards (with subordinates), sideways (with peers), and outside (with clients)
- His key argument is that success in the workplace, especially in a leadership or consultancy role, requires an understanding of how to manage these relationships, with a particular emphasis on communication, aligning with others' needs, and creating of mutual value
