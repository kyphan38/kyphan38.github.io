- Present main types (with elaboration): outline 2-3 distinct categories, providing brief explanations, characteristics, or examples for each
- (Optional) Add nuance/further dimension: briefly mention overlapping categories, influencing factors, or less common types to show deeper thinking
- (Optional) Brief concluding remark: a short sentence to round off, if needed
