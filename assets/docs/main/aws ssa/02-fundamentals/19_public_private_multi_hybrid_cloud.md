Public Cloud: Great for small businesses, startups, or teams that need to scale resources quickly and affordably without investing in infrastructure

Private Cloud: Ideal for businesses with sensitive data, compliance needs, or those that need full control over their infrastructure

Multi-Cloud: Best for organizations that want flexibility, resiliency, or need specific capabilities from different cloud providers
