# consulting client management

This section talks about a new definition of clients that includes everyone you connect with in a workplace

The clients inside a company will be treated very differently than the ones "outside" of a company

The scenario video will cover how to engage with peers, leaders, and subordinates as well as clients inside and outside a company

Negotiating conflict is essential because it is rare and yet important when it arises. Having a method deal with is essential

## Identifying clients

Redefining "client"

- The term "client" extends far beyond external customers to encompass everyone (boss, coworkers, employees, etc.), we interact with professionally

Managing your leaders

- Understand your boss's priorities
  - In terms of title, they have different concerns which are related to strategy
- Proactively communicate with minimal details
  - They want minimal amounts of communication, short contextual snippets
  - In an issue situation, they do not need to know what the problem is, who is on it, how they are fixing it, etc. These are saved for the engineers or the incident manager
- Continually seek feedback on major outcomes
  - They want to know how these things are operating
  - In a rollout situation, they want to know it is green or yellow or red? Do we have feature parity? What is the customer feedback?
- Progress to create alignment
  - Ensure everything is in alignment with our strategy, mission, and vision
- Be consistent to build trust and rapport (close relationship)

Engaging your peers

- Your co-workers are more than just team members
- They are your internal clients, each with unique needs and contributions

Nurturing your employees as clients

- Understand their ambitions
  - If they don't have, let's connect with them things related to goals, needs, desire
  - Average actually runs the world, exceptional changes it
- Provide feedback and guidance to their needs and goals
- Create opportunities for them to grow
- Be transparent, protective, and curious
  - Give them a sense that you are on their team and have got their backs
  - When they have made a mistake and you need to offer correction
  - Also, to be curious about what they are doing and working for you, to be observant and to listen what they tell you

External vs internal clients

- External clients usually pay the bills while internal clients provide the service to the external clients
- Professionalism is a must with external clients
- Higher standards in quality, positivity, and timeliness is required for external clients, but still needed for internal as well
  - Can-do positive attitude
  - They want to know you are at least willing to take in and consider their request or their idea
  - If you do make an agreement with a client, remember that you are at all times communicating that this is subject to change, interrupt and you absolutely must get this done by this time frame

Integrating a client-centric approach

- Always be curious
  - What is the client asking for that? What do they need it for?
- Active listening
- Communicate and document
  - Don't walk away from a meeting without having a summary and don't even get into a meeting without some kind of loose agenda
  - Eg: Here is the action items I have. Is this accurate from the last meeting? Yes, good. I am gonna start working on them
- Seek feedback and adapt to improve
  - When you tell them about the things you are working on, the direction you are heading, you are giving people opportunity to say "we are in alignment"

**Summary**

- We explored a broader definition of client that included leaders, coworkers, employees, and your external clients
- This concept is meant to encourage engagement and professionalism with all work relationships
- A client-centric approach also requires a systemic approach to navigating expectations and conflict
- Treating everyone as a client will create a deeper sense of rapport and alignment with everyone around you

## Story - Managing up, down, sideways and outside

Context

- The focus of speaker's talk is on managing relationships "upwards" (with bosses), "downwards" (with subordinates), "sideways" (with peers), and "outside" (with clients)
- His key argument is that success in the workplace, especially in a leadership or consultancy role, requires an understanding of how to manage these relationships, with a particular emphasis on communication, alignment with others' needs, and the creation of mutual value
- He uses the example of a forward-thinking architect in a company who fails to engage his colleagues, illustrating how a lack of balance in relationship management can lead to misalignment and dysfunction
- The overarching lesson is about "client management" - treating everyone as a "client," no matter their position in the hierarchy

Actions and Result

- Treat everyone as a client
  - Treat your boss, peers, subordinates, and external clients as "clients" with distinct needs and expectations. This approach prioritizes understanding and meeting their needs in a way that benefits both parties
  - When you approach relationships from a client-centric perspective, you shift from transactional interactions (where the goal is simply to get things done) to collaborative, value-driven interactions that build long-term trust and rapport
- Inquire and be curious about their needs
  - Actively engage with your team members, peers, and leaders by asking questions to understand their goals, challenges, and preferences
  - Understanding the needs of others allows you to tailor your approach and communication to resonate with them. It also signals respect for their perspectives, which fosters mutual trust and better collaboration
- Create feedback loops
  - Establish feedback mechanisms where others can voice their thoughts and input, and ensure you listen actively
  - Continuous feedback promotes open communication, helps to align efforts, and fosters an environment of growth. Active listening, in particular, ensures that you're not just hearing, but understanding, which enables you to act in ways that are more beneficial to the team
- Align actions with their needs and expectations
  - Adjust your approach to meet the individual needs of the people you're working with, ensuring that you fulfill their expectations
  - Aligning actions to the needs of others makes your efforts more relevant and appreciated. It leads to better outcomes because everyone feels understood and supported in their role
- Prioritize what matters most to them
  - Understand which needs are urgent and which are less critical, and focus on delivering what truly matters to your stakeholders
  - Prioritization ensures that resources are allocated efficiently and that the most impactful actions are taken first. It prevents overwhelm and demonstrates that you're committed to delivering results that matter
- Build trust through consistency
  - Be consistent in your actions and communications. Follow through on commitments and demonstrate reliability
  - Trust is the foundation of any successful relationship. By consistently delivering on promises and maintaining clear communication, you demonstrate integrity and reliability, which builds stronger rapport
- Provide value to everyone
  - Whether you're managing up, down, sideways, or outside, make sure you're delivering tangible value to everyone you interact with. This could be in the form of solving problems, offering support, or helping others achieve their goals
  - When people feel they are receiving value from their relationship with you, they are more likely to trust and engage with you. This is particularly important in the workplace, where collaboration and alignment are essential to success
- Continuous improvement
  - Continuously work on improving your communication, listening, and relationship-building skills. Stay open to feedback and refine your approach as needed
  - Relationships and work environments evolve. Regular self-reflection and improvement ensure that you remain effective in managing relationships and contributing to the team's success
