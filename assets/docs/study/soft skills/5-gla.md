## Story - What to Learn When There Is Too Much to Know

Context

- The IT and DevOps landscape in 2024 is overwhelming - rapid change, constant evolution, and way too many tools and platforms to keep up with
- AI has dramatically shifted the game in just the past 18 months, automating tasks that used to require manual work
- Engineers today are expected to juggle everything from databases to Kubernetes, from CI/CD pipelines to multi-cloud deployments
- The sheer amount of tech knowledge out there creates confusion, especially for beginners who don't know where to start
- Learning everything is impossible - and trying to will leave you burnt out and stuck
- Success requires a focused, strategic approach to learning that balances current needs with long-term goals

Actions and result

- Focus on the present
  - Learn only what's relevant to your current role or task - for example, if you're setting up GitLab CI/CD, go deep on that instead of exploring unrelated tools
  - You perform better in your current role, feel less overwhelmed, and build real-world experience that matters now
- Build a strong foundation
  - Start with core concepts (like basic Kubernetes) and then incrementally build on them - link each new tool or idea back to what you already understand
  - You develop deeper knowledge over time without drowning in complexity, and retain information more effectively
- Stay strategic
  - Spend 80% of your learning time on what you need now, and 20% on where you want your career to go - like security, SRE, or AI operations
  - You build a career path, not just a random set of skills. You're not just surviving - you're growing toward your future
- Embrace meta-skills
  - Intentionally improve in areas like communication, collaboration, and learning how to learn - things that aren't tech tools but are critical in the workplace
  - You stand out as a more effective, well-rounded engineer who can thrive in fast-moving, team-driven environments
